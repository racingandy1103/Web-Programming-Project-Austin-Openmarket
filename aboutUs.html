                Our goal with Austin OpenMarket is to promote environmentally-friendly second-hand shopping. <a href= "https://www.epa.gov/recycle/reducing-and-reusing-basics">Studies </a> have shown that reusing and recycling products 
                helps to reduce greenhouse emissions that contribute to global climate change. We create an economic incentive with low pricing to encourage people 
                in the Austin community to buy or sell used items. Buying or selling second-hand clothes encourages sustainable fashion. Fashion is a water-intensive 
                industry. For example, a crop like cotton requires a lot of water. Each cotton shirt requires approximately <a href="https://farmandanimals.com/how-much-water-does-it-take-to-grow-cotton/#:~:text=Despite%20being%20known%20as%20a,water%20to%20maximize%20its%20yield.">2700 litres</a> of water! By using Austin 
                OpenMarket, not only can you help reduce water to save the environment, but you can find things that you actually need for a discounted price!
